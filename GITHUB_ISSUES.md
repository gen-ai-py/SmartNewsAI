## HIGH PRIORITY ISSUES

### Issue #1: Memory Leak in Recommendation Engine During Batch Processing
**Priority: High** | **Type: Critical Bug** | **Labels: bug, performance, critical**

**Description:**
The hybrid recommendation system appears to have a memory leak when processing large batches of user interactions. During continuous operation with more than 1000 users, memory usage grows significantly and doesn't get released, eventually causing the system to crash.

**Expected Behavior:**
Memory usage should remain stable during long-running recommendation processes, with proper garbage collection of temporary objects.

**Actual Behavior:**
Memory usage continuously increases during batch recommendation processing, leading to system crashes after processing ~5000+ recommendations in a single session.

**Steps to Reproduce:**
1. Load the recommendation system with a large dataset (>1000 users, >10000 interactions)
2. Run continuous recommendation generation for multiple users in a loop
3. Monitor memory usage - it increases steadily and doesn't decrease
4. System eventually crashes with out-of-memory error

**Impact:** Critical - affects production deployment and scalability

**Environment:**
- Python 3.8+
- Large datasets (production-scale)
- Long-running processes

### Issue #2: Classification Model Shows Poor Performance on Short Articles
**Priority: High** | **Type: Performance Issue** | **Labels: machine-learning, performance, bug**

**Description:**
The news classifier performs significantly worse on short articles (less than 100 characters) compared to longer articles. This is problematic as many headlines and brief news updates are being misclassified.

**Expected Behavior:**
Classification accuracy should be consistent across different article lengths, with reasonable performance even on short content.

**Actual Behavior:**
- Articles >200 characters: ~85% accuracy
- Articles 100-200 characters: ~65% accuracy  
- Articles <100 characters: ~45% accuracy

**Technical Details:**
The TF-IDF vectorizer may not be capturing enough features from short texts, and the minimum document frequency settings might be filtering out important short-text features.

**Suggested Solutions:**
1. Adjust TF-IDF parameters for short text handling
2. Implement character-level n-grams
3. Consider using word embeddings or BERT for better short text understanding
4. Add text augmentation for short articles during training

**Impact:** Affects user experience and system reliability for news headlines and brief updates.

### Issue #3: Training Pipeline Fails with Corrupted UTF-8 Characters in News Content
**Priority: High** | **Type: Critical Bug** | **Labels: bug, data-processing, critical**

**Description:**
The data preprocessing pipeline crashes when encountering certain UTF-8 characters in news articles, particularly articles containing special characters, emojis, or non-English content.

**Error Message:**
```
UnicodeDecodeError: 'utf-8' codec can't decode byte 0xe9 in position 234: invalid start byte
```

**Expected Behavior:**
The system should gracefully handle all UTF-8 characters and international content without crashing.

**Actual Behavior:**
Training fails completely when corrupted or unusual UTF-8 characters are encountered, requiring manual data cleaning.

**Steps to Reproduce:**
1. Include articles with special characters, emojis, or mixed encoding in the dataset
2. Run the training pipeline
3. System crashes during text preprocessing

**Impact:** Critical - prevents training on real-world datasets that contain international content or social media text.

**Proposed Fix:**
Implement robust encoding handling with fallback options and character normalization.

### Issue #4: Recommendation System Returns Duplicate Articles
**Priority: High** | **Type: Logic Bug** | **Labels: bug, recommendation-system**

**Description:**
The hybrid recommendation system occasionally returns duplicate articles in the recommendation list, especially for users with limited interaction history. This creates a poor user experience and reduces recommendation diversity.

**Expected Behavior:**
Each recommendation list should contain unique articles with no duplicates.

**Actual Behavior:**
Duplicate articles appear in recommendation lists, sometimes the same article appears 2-3 times in a single recommendation set.

**Conditions When It Occurs:**
- Users with <10 interactions
- Categories with limited article variety
- When content-based and collaborative scores are very similar

**Steps to Reproduce:**
1. Create a new user with minimal interactions (2-3 articles)
2. Request recommendations
3. Observe duplicate articles in the returned list

**Impact:** Degrades user experience and reduces trust in the recommendation system.

### Issue #5: Model Serialization Fails for Large Feature Extractors
**Priority: High** | **Type: Critical Bug** | **Labels: bug, model-persistence, critical**

**Description:**
When saving models with large vocabulary (>10,000 features), the joblib serialization process fails or produces corrupted files that cannot be loaded correctly.

**Expected Behavior:**
All trained models should save and load correctly regardless of size, maintaining full functionality.

**Actual Behavior:**
- Large models fail to save with memory errors
- Sometimes models appear to save but fail to load with corruption errors
- Feature extractors lose vocabulary mapping after save/load cycle

**Error Examples:**
```
MemoryError: Unable to allocate array with shape (50000, 10000) and data type float64
```
or
```
PicklingError: Could not serialize object of type <class 'scipy.sparse.csr_matrix'>
```

**Impact:** Critical - prevents deployment of production models and makes it impossible to persist trained systems.

**Suggested Solutions:**
1. Implement chunked serialization for large sparse matrices
2. Use HDF5 format for large model components
3. Separate vocabulary and weights serialization

## NORMAL PRIORITY ISSUES

### Issue #6: Add Cross-Validation Support to Model Comparison Module
**Priority: Normal** | **Type: Enhancement** | **Labels: enhancement, machine-learning**

**Description:**
The current model comparison functionality only uses a single train-test split, which may not provide a robust comparison of different algorithms. Adding k-fold cross-validation would give more reliable performance estimates.

**Current Implementation:**
Single 80/20 train-test split for model evaluation.

**Proposed Enhancement:**
Implement stratified k-fold cross-validation (default k=5) in the ModelComparison class with:
- Mean and standard deviation of performance metrics
- Statistical significance testing between models
- Configurable number of folds
- Option to use both single split and cross-validation

**Benefits:**
- More robust model selection
- Better understanding of model stability
- Statistical confidence in model comparisons

**Implementation Details:**
- Add `use_cross_validation` parameter to ModelComparison
- Implement statistical testing (paired t-test) between models
- Add visualization of cross-validation results

### Issue #7: Implement Logging Configuration and Rotation
**Priority: Normal** | **Type: Enhancement** | **Labels: enhancement, logging, infrastructure**

**Description:**
The current logging system writes everything to a single file without rotation, which can lead to very large log files in production. Need to implement proper logging configuration with rotation, levels, and multiple handlers.

**Current State:**
- Single log file (`smart_news_ai.log`)
- No log rotation
- Limited log level configuration

**Desired Features:**
1. Log rotation (daily/size-based)
2. Configurable log levels per module
3. Separate log files for different components (classifier, recommender, API)
4. Structured logging with timestamps and module names
5. Option to log to console, file, or both
6. Configuration via config file or environment variables

**Implementation Suggestions:**
- Use Python's `logging.config` module
- Add YAML/JSON configuration files
- Implement log file compression for archived logs
- Add log monitoring hooks for production deployment
